# Collagen-Capped-Silver-Nanoparticles
The following project aimed the creation of silver nanoparticles with a collagen coat that present antibacterial activity, the characterization was mad with the use of ELISA technique and Nanodrop 
The Rstudio Code make an ANOVA analysis of the values obtained in order to determine the best ratio for the formation of the nps
The file Data_Acosta contains all the information obtained from the distinct equipments such as the Source of collagen, the reducing solution, ratio and the absorbances.
The file datos nanodrop, contains the information obtained from the nanodrop in order to perform the analysis, the second page of that file contains the values of the antimicrobial assay performed with ELISA technique.
